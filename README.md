  [project review.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20323223/project.review.pdf)
In today's digital education landscape, accessibility remains a major barrier for students with visual and hearing impairments. This project proposes the development of an Inclusive Learning Platform designed to bridge this gap by integrating sign language interpretation and visual aids to ensure equitable access to educational content.
	The platform employs a dual-mode learning approachâ€”text-to-speech (TTS) systems for visually impaired learners and interactive sign language modules for hearing-impaired users. Additionally, the interface is optimized for screen reader compatibility and offers customizable features such as high-contrast modes, subtitle integration, and gesture-based navigation.
